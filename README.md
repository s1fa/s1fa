## Hi there 👋

I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Bioinformatics at a university, with a research focus on Evolutionary Biology. My interests include:

- 🔬 Evolutionary Biology
- 🤖 Machine Learning
- 🧠 Generative Large Models
- 📊 Deep Learning for solving biological problems

I'm actively learning about machine learning and deep learning to apply these techniques in my research. I aim to leverage deep learning to uncover insights and solve complex problems in biology.

Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate or discuss any exciting ideas!
