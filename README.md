## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Bioinformatics at a university, with a research focus on Evolutionary Biology. My interests include:

- ðŸ”¬ Evolutionary Biology
- ðŸ¤– Machine Learning
- ðŸ§  Generative Large Models
- ðŸ“Š Deep Learning for solving biological problems

I'm actively learning about machine learning and deep learning to apply these techniques in my research. I aim to leverage deep learning to uncover insights and solve complex problems in biology.

Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate or discuss any exciting ideas!
